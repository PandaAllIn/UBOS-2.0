# UBOS Kernel Implementation Plan
version: 1.0.0
status: active

## Technical Stack
- Runtime: Node.js 20+ with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL for persistent state
- Cache: Redis for real-time operations
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ for agent orchestration
- Blockchain: Hyperledger for transparent governance

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Spec-Driven?
- Specs are source of truth
- AI agents can understand and implement specs
- Changes tracked through spec evolution
- Validation built into every layer

### Core Components
1. Spec Interpreter (Priority 1)
2. Credit System (Priority 2)
3. Territory Loader (Priority 3)
4. Metamorphosis Engine (Priority 4)

## Implementation Phases
- Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Phase 2: Economic Layer
- Phase 3: Territory System
- Phase 4: Agent Orchestration
- Phase 5: Metamorphosis

## Validation Criteria
- All specs parseable
- Credits maintain backing ratio
- Territories self-initialize
- Agents collaborate successfully
- System accepts new specs without restart
