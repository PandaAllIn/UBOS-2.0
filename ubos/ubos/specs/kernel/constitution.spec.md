## Principles
1. All changes must be spec-driven

5. Everyone wins in their own way

## Governance
- Decisions weighted by credits and contributions
- Specs are laws, executable and transparent
- System evolves through metamorphosis

## Rights
- Every citizen can earn credits
- Every agent has purpose
- Every territory is autonomous
- Every contribution is valued

## The Infinite Game
We play to continue playing, not to win over others.
Success is measured by system health and citizen satisfaction.
