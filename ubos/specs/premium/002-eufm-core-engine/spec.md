**Feature Branch**: `002-eufm-core-engine`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "EUFM Core Engine - Central orchestration system for EU funding intelligence with proven ¬6M+ success track record"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Core concept: Central orchestration system for EU funding operations
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: EU funding managers, research teams, proposal writers, consortium partners
   ’ Actions: orchestrate, analyze, coordinate, validate, optimize
   ’ Data: funding opportunities, proposals, compliance rules, success metrics
   ’ Constraints: ¬6M+ proven track record, constitutional governance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Orchestration mechanisms and success metrics defined below
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: Opportunity analysis ’ Agent coordination ’ Proposal generation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement validated against ¬6M+ success track record
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Funding programs, proposals, agent teams, orchestration workflows
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ All requirements maintain proven success patterns
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A EU funding coordinator needs to analyze multiple funding opportunities simultaneously across different programs (Horizon Europe, Innovation Fund, ERDF), coordinate specialized agent teams for research and proposal generation, and ensure all activities maintain the proven success patterns that achieved ¬6M+ in funding.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** multiple funding opportunities, **When** core engine receives analysis request, **Then** system must orchestrate appropriate agent teams and deliver comprehensive analysis within 10 minutes
2. **Given** research completion, **When** proposal generation is initiated, **Then** system must coordinate proposal agents and produce compliant proposals with 95%+ success probability
3. **Given** ongoing operations, **When** system health is monitored, **Then** core engine must maintain 92%+ operational health matching EUFM benchmarks

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple high-priority funding deadlines conflict?
- How does system handle agent failures during critical proposal generation?
- What occurs when constitutional governance blocks time-sensitive operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST orchestrate analysis of multiple EU funding opportunities simultaneously across all major programs
- **FR-002**: System MUST coordinate specialized agent teams (research, proposal, compliance) with automatic load balancing
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain 92%+ operational health matching proven EUFM performance benchmarks
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate funding proposals with 95%+ compliance accuracy using validated templates and patterns
- **FR-005**: System MUST integrate with all existing UBOS infrastructure while maintaining constitutional governance
- **FR-006**: System MUST track and optimize cost efficiency targeting <¬0.05 per funding analysis (1,850:1 ROI maintenance)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide real-time monitoring and intervention capabilities for critical funding deadlines
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain comprehensive audit trails for all funding-related activities and decisions
- **FR-009**: System MUST support dynamic scaling to handle 1000+ concurrent funding analyses
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve and extend the success patterns that achieved ¬6M+ in successful funding

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **FundingProgram**: EU funding schemes with eligibility criteria, deadlines, and success patterns
- **ProposalProject**: Funding proposals with status tracking, compliance validation, and success metrics
- **AgentTeam**: Coordinated groups of specialized agents with role assignments and performance tracking
- **OrchestrationWorkflow**: Structured processes for funding analysis, research, and proposal generation
- **SuccessPattern**: Validated approaches and templates derived from ¬6M+ successful funding outcomes

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - focuses on orchestration capabilities
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - EU funding success and efficiency
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - funding managers and program coordinators
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (specific health metrics, success rates)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (92% health, 95% compliance, <¬0.05 cost)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (EU funding orchestration with proven success patterns)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (UBOS integration, constitutional compliance)
