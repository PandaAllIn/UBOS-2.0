# Feature Specification: EUFM Metamorphic Agents System

**Feature Branch**: `001-eufm-metamorphic-agents`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "EUFM Metamorphic Agents System - AI agents that can adapt to any business domain with Perplexity research and autonomous execution capabilities"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Core concept: AI agents that dynamically adapt to business domains
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: EUFM agents, business stakeholders, EU funding managers
   ’ Actions: adapt, research, execute, analyze, generate
   ’ Data: business domain specs, research findings, execution results
   ’ Constraints: Constitutional governance, EUR-backed economics
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Business adaptation mechanisms defined below
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: Domain adaptation ’ Research ’ Implementation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable via agent output validation
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Agent configurations, business domains, research data
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ All requirements are measurable and domain-agnostic
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A EU funding manager needs to quickly analyze opportunities in a new business domain (e.g., CleanTech, Healthcare, RegionalDev). The metamorphic agents automatically adapt their research capabilities, knowledge base, and analysis methods to become domain experts within minutes, then conduct comprehensive research and provide actionable recommendations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new business domain request, **When** agents receive domain specification, **Then** agents must adapt their capabilities and knowledge within 90 seconds
2. **Given** domain-adapted agents, **When** research request is submitted, **Then** system must deliver comprehensive analysis with 95%+ confidence within 5 minutes
3. **Given** research completion, **When** implementation specs are generated, **Then** system must produce executable specifications that pass constitutional validation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when domain requires specialized knowledge not in training data?
- How does system handle conflicting domain requirements or invalid specifications?
- What occurs when research sources provide contradictory information?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST dynamically adapt agent capabilities to any specified business domain within 90 seconds
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate Perplexity/Sonar API for real-time research with cost target <¬0.05 per query
- **FR-003**: Agents MUST maintain 95%+ confidence in research recommendations through multi-source validation
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate executable specifications from research findings using SpecKit standards
- **FR-005**: System MUST log all agent activities via UBOS agentActionLogger for constitutional compliance
- **FR-006**: Agents MUST coordinate with existing 20+ UBOS agents through established orchestration protocols
- **FR-007**: System MUST support autonomous background execution with progress monitoring and human intervention capabilities
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate all actions against UBOS constitutional governance before execution
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain EUR-backed economic tracking for all research and execution activities
- **FR-010**: Agents MUST support metamorphosis (hot-reloading) when domain specifications change

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MetamorphicAgent**: Base agent class with domain adaptation, research, and execution capabilities
- **BusinessDomain**: Configuration specifying industry focus, research parameters, and success metrics
- **ResearchResult**: Multi-source validated findings with confidence scores and source attribution
- **AgentConfiguration**: Dynamic agent setup including capabilities, tools, and domain-specific knowledge
- **ExecutionHandle**: Background process management with progress tracking and intervention controls
