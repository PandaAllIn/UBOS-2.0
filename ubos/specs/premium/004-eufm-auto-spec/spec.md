**Feature Branch**: `004-eufm-auto-spec`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "EUFM Auto-Spec Generator - AI system that creates living specifications from research findings"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Core concept: AI-powered specification generation from research data
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: System architects, project managers, development teams, stakeholders
   ’ Actions: generate, validate, update, version, govern
   ’ Data: Research findings, requirements, templates, governance rules
   ’ Constraints: SpecKit compatibility, constitutional compliance, living documents
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Specification generation algorithms and validation processes defined below
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: Research input ’ Template selection ’ Spec generation ’ Validation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement ensures spec quality and system integration
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Spec templates, research data, generated specifications, validation results
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ All requirements support living documentation and governance
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A project manager receives comprehensive research findings about a new EU funding opportunity and needs detailed implementation specifications. The auto-spec generator analyzes the research, selects appropriate templates, and generates living specifications that automatically integrate with the UBOS constitutional governance system and trigger MetamorphosisWatcher updates.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** validated research findings, **When** spec generation is requested, **Then** system must produce complete SpecKit-compatible specifications within 30 seconds
2. **Given** generated specifications, **When** constitutional validation occurs, **Then** system must achieve 100% governance compliance and citizen approval readiness
3. **Given** approved specifications, **When** system changes occur, **Then** specs must automatically update via MetamorphosisWatcher integration

### Edge Cases
- What happens when research findings are incomplete or contradictory?
- How does system handle template selection when no perfect match exists?
- What occurs when generated specs conflict with constitutional governance rules?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate complete SpecKit-compatible specifications from research findings within 30 seconds
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically select and customize appropriate specification templates based on research domain and scope
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate all generated specifications against UBOS constitutional governance requirements before output
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate with MetamorphosisWatcher for automatic specification updates and system evolution
- **FR-005**: System MUST support living specifications that evolve based on implementation feedback and system changes
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain specification version control with complete change tracking and audit trails
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate specifications that achieve 90%+ successful implementation rate when executed
- **FR-008**: System MUST submit constitutional specifications for citizen review and voting when required
- **FR-009**: System MUST support batch generation of related specifications for complex multi-component projects
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide specification quality metrics and validation feedback for continuous improvement

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **SpecTemplate**: Reusable specification patterns with customization parameters and validation rules
- **ResearchInput**: Validated research findings formatted for specification generation processing
- **GeneratedSpec**: Complete SpecKit-compatible specifications with metadata and validation status
- **ValidationResult**: Constitutional and technical compliance validation with approval recommendations
- **SpecEvolution**: Change tracking and versioning for living specification management
