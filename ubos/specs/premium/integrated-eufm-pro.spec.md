# Feature Specification: Integrated EUFM Pro Service

**Feature Branch**: `integrated-eufm-pro`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Tier**: Premium Service (€299-999/month)

## Overview
EUFM Pro is the premium service tier of UBOS that transforms the €50B+ EU funding landscape through AI-powered research, automated proposal generation, and metamorphic agent capabilities. Built on the proven €6M+ funding success of UBOS constitutional governance.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. User accesses UBOS platform with EUFM Pro subscription
   → Tier validation ensures premium access
2. Constitutional governance validates all premium operations
   → EUR-backed credits consumed transparently
3. Metamorphic agents adapt to specific funding domains
   → Deep research using Sonar models provides comprehensive analysis
4. Auto-spec generation creates living documentation
   → Background execution implements complex funding strategies
5. Return: Premium EU funding intelligence with constitutional oversight
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An EU funding manager with EUFM Pro subscription needs to analyze opportunities across multiple domains (GeoDataCenter geothermal, Portal Oradea regional development). The integrated system provides metamorphic agents that adapt to each domain, conducts deep research using Sonar models, generates executable specifications, and provides autonomous implementation while maintaining constitutional governance and transparent EUR-backed credit consumption.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** EUFM Pro subscription, **When** user accesses premium features, **Then** system validates tier access and enables deep research capabilities
2. **Given** funding opportunity analysis request, **When** metamorphic agents process domain requirements, **Then** system delivers comprehensive research with 95%+ confidence within 90 seconds
3. **Given** research completion, **When** auto-spec generation activates, **Then** system produces SpecKit-compatible specifications with constitutional validation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user exceeds monthly premium limits?
- How does system handle tier downgrade during active research?
- What occurs when constitutional governance blocks premium operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate EUFM Pro as premium tier within existing UBOS constitutional framework
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate service tier access using EUR-backed credit consumption before premium operations
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide metamorphic agents that adapt to any EU funding domain within 90 seconds
- **FR-004**: System MUST conduct deep research using Sonar models with constitutional action logging
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate living specifications integrated with existing SpecKit and MetamorphosisWatcher
- **FR-006**: System MUST support autonomous background execution while maintaining citizen oversight
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain 92%+ system health matching existing UBOS performance benchmarks
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide seamless upgrade/downgrade between Community → Pro → Enterprise tiers
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate with existing agent orchestration system (20+ existing agents)
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain constitutional compliance with transparent economic tracking

### Technical Integration Requirements
- **TI-001**: All premium agents MUST extend existing BaseAgent class and integrate with agentActionLogger
- **TI-002**: Service tier validation MUST be enforced before accessing premium features
- **TI-003**: EUR-backed credits MUST be consumed transparently with constitutional audit trails
- **TI-004**: Premium features MUST integrate with existing Perplexity adapter and agent orchestration
- **TI-005**: All specifications MUST be compatible with existing MetamorphosisWatcher hot-reload system

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **EUFMProService**: Premium service orchestrator with tier validation and credit consumption
- **MetamorphicAgent**: Domain-adaptive agents extending existing UBOS BaseAgent architecture
- **TierGate**: Service tier validation ensuring appropriate access to premium features
- **ConstitutionalValidator**: Integration with existing UBOS governance system for premium operations
- **CreditLedger**: EUR-backed transaction tracking integrated with existing constitutional economics

## Integration Architecture

### **Service Tier Structure**
```
UBOS Platform
├── Community Tier (Free)
│   ├── Basic EUFM tools
│   ├── Core UBOS agents
│   └── Constitutional participation
└── Premium Tiers (Paid)
    ├── EUFM Pro (€299/month)
    │   ├── Deep research (Sonar)
    │   ├── Metamorphic agents
    │   ├── Auto-spec generation
    │   └── Advanced analytics
    └── EUFM Enterprise (€999/month)
        ├── Background execution
        ├── API access
        ├── White-label deployment
        └── Custom agent development
```

### **Constitutional Integration**
- All premium operations subject to existing UBOS governance
- EUR-backed credits consumed with full transparency
- Citizen voting rights maintained across all tiers
- Premium revenue contributes to constitutional treasury

### **Technical Implementation Path**
```typescript
// Premium service initialization
const eufmPro = new EUFMProService(userId, subscription);
await eufmPro.validateTierAccess('deepResearch');
await eufmPro.consumeCredits(0.10, 'sonar-research');

// Existing UBOS integration
const agent = new MetamorphicAgent('research_001', 'funding_analysis');
await agent.adaptToDomain('geothermal_energy');
const result = await agent.run(options, context);
```
