## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A funding analyst needs comprehensive research on a specific EU funding opportunity including regulatory requirements, successful precedents, competitor analysis, and partnership opportunities. The research agent must deliver validated, actionable intelligence using Sonar Deep Research model (the most powerful available) for maximum quality and accuracy.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a funding research request, **When** research agent processes the query, **Then** system must deliver comprehensive analysis within 90 seconds using Sonar Deep Research model
2. **Given** research completion, **When** findings are validated, **Then** system must achieve 95%+ confidence through multi-source cross-validation
3. **Given** validated research, **When** recommendations are generated, **Then** system must provide actionable insights with clear source attribution and next steps

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Perplexity API is unavailable or rate-limited?
- How does system handle research topics with limited or conflicting sources?
- What occurs when research cost approaches the �0.05 limit before completion?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate Perplexity/Sonar API for real-time web research with intelligent query optimization
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain research cost below �0.05 per query while delivering comprehensive analysis
- **FR-003**: System MUST achieve 95%+ confidence in recommendations through multi-source validation and credibility scoring
- **FR-004**: System MUST complete comprehensive EU funding research within 90 seconds including analysis and validation
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide full source attribution for all findings enabling regulatory compliance and audit trails
- **FR-006**: System MUST monitor and adapt to EU legislative changes in real-time across all major funding programs
- **FR-007**: System MUST support specialized research domains including geothermal energy, regional development, and clean technology
- **FR-008**: System MUST cache and optimize repeated queries to maximize cost efficiency and response speed
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate with existing UBOS agents for seamless research-to-implementation workflows
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain the 1,850:1 ROI advantage over traditional consulting approaches

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ResearchQuery**: Structured research requests with domain, scope, and priority specifications
- **SourceData**: Multi-source research findings with credibility scores and validation status
- **IntelligenceReport**: Synthesized analysis with recommendations, confidence levels, and source attribution
- **ValidationResult**: Multi-source cross-validation with confidence scoring and bias detection
- **CostTracker**: Real-time monitoring of research expenses with optimization recommendations
