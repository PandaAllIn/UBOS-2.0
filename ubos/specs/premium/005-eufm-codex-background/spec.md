## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A project manager has approved specifications for a complex EU funding platform component (like GeoDataCenter monitoring system). The background execution system autonomously breaks down the specifications into implementation tasks, generates code using Codex CLI, runs comprehensive tests, and deploys the working system while providing real-time progress monitoring and requesting human intervention only when critical decisions are required.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** approved specifications, **When** background execution is initiated, **Then** system must decompose project and begin autonomous implementation within 2 minutes
2. **Given** ongoing execution, **When** progress is monitored, **Then** system must provide real-time status updates and request human intervention only for critical decisions
3. **Given** implementation completion, **When** validation occurs, **Then** system must achieve 85%+ test pass rate and 100% constitutional compliance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Codex API fails or becomes unavailable during critical execution?
- How does system handle implementation tasks that require human domain expertise?
- What occurs when background execution conflicts with system resource limits?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST autonomously decompose complex specifications into granular, executable implementation tasks
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate OpenAI Codex CLI for intelligent code generation with context awareness across sessions
- **FR-003**: System MUST execute implementations in isolated background processes with resource monitoring and limits
- **FR-004**: System MUST achieve 85%+ test pass rate for all generated implementations through automated quality assurance
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time progress monitoring with detailed status updates every 30 seconds
- **FR-006**: System MUST request human intervention only for critical decisions while maintaining autonomous operation
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate all implementations against constitutional governance requirements before deployment
- **FR-008**: System MUST support pausable and resumable execution with checkpoint saves for long-running projects
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain cost efficiency targeting <¬1 per implementation hour while ensuring quality
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with EUFM core engine for coordinated multi-agent implementation workflows

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ExecutionHandle**: Background process management with status tracking and intervention controls
- **TaskTree**: Hierarchical decomposition of specifications into executable implementation units
- **CodeImplementation**: Generated code with validation status, test results, and deployment configuration
- **ProgressMonitor**: Real-time execution tracking with milestone reporting and intervention triggers
- **QualityGate**: Automated validation checkpoints ensuring implementation quality and compliance

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - focuses on execution capabilities
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - autonomous, quality implementation delivery
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - project managers and system operators
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (specific success rates, timeframes, cost targets)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (85% test pass, <¬1/hour, 100% compliance)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (autonomous implementation with Codex integration)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (API availability, constitutional governance)
