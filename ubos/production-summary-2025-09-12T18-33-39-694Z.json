Focuses on creating detailed specifications before coding to reduce errors and inefficiencies\n\nI need to organize this into a comprehensive documentation format as requested, making sure to cite the search results appropriately and follow the formatting guidelines.\n</think>\n\nGitHub Spec Kit is an open-source specification-driven development (SDD) framework that revolutionizes how developers plan and build software projects with AI coding agents. By prioritizing detailed documentation and clear specifications over assumption-based coding, Spec Kit helps eliminate errors, reduce inefficiencies, and create more reliable development workflows[1][4].\n\n## Overview & Purpose\n\n**What Spec Kit Does**\n\nSpec Kit transforms vague project ideas into actionable, well-documented specifications that AI coding agents can reliably execute. The framework addresses a critical challenge in modern software development: unclear or incomplete specifications that lead to errors when using coding agents like GitHub Copilot, Claude, or Gemini CLI[1][4].\n\n**Main Use Cases**\n\n- **AI-Assisted Development**: Optimizing workflows with GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI\n- **Complex Multi-Feature Projects**: Managing large-scale development initiatives with multiple components\n- **Team Collaboration**: Creating shared understanding through detailed specifications\n- **Quality Assurance**: Reducing bugs and rework through comprehensive planning\n- **Test-Driven Development**: Integrating TDD methodologies with specification-driven approaches[1][2]\n\n**Core Philosophy**\n\nSpec Kit operates on the principle that **intent becomes the source of truth**. Instead of code being the authoritative artifact, the specification document serves as the primary reference point, with AI models constantly referring back to it for guidance on how to proceed[3].\n\n## Installation & Setup\n\n**Prerequisites**\n- Python environment with `uvx` package manager\n- Git access to GitHub repositories\n- Preferred AI coding agent (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI)\n\n**Installation Command**\n\n```bash\nuvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>\n```\n\n**Setup Process**\n\n1. **Initialize Project**: Run the installation command with your desired project name\n2. **Choose AI Agent**: Select your preferred agentic framework (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI)\n3. **Open Workspace**: Launch your code editor to access the generated project structure[4]\n\n**Project Structure**\n\nAfter initialization, Spec Kit creates:\n- **Scripts Folder**: Contains execution scripts that prepare specification documents\n- **Templates Folder**: Boilerplate spec templates used to generate actual spec files\n- **Project Configuration**: Setup files for your chosen AI agent[3]\n\n## Core Features\n\n**Specification-Driven Framework**\n\nSpec Kit employs a **four-step project implementation process**:\n1. **Define Goals**: Establish clear project objectives and requirements\n2. **Develop Technical Architecture**: Create detailed technical implementation plans\n3. **Break Down Tasks**: Convert specifications into actionable development units\n4. **Test-Driven Development**: Implement accuracy validation through comprehensive testing[1]\n\n**AI Agent Integration**\n\n- **Seamless Integration**: Works natively with GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI\n- **Command-Based Interface**: Simplified project management through intuitive commands\n- **Dynamic Updates**: Automatic project file updates for better organization and tracking\n- **MCP Server Compatibility**: Works with existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for enhanced research capabilities[1][2]\n\n**Template System**\n\nCurrent template versions (v0.0.22) include:\n- `spec-kit-template-copilot-v0.0.22.zip`\n- `spec-kit-template-claude-v0.0.22.zip`  \n- `spec-kit-template-gemini-v0.0.22.zip`[5]\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n**Basic Workflow Commands**\n\n**1. Create Initial Specification**\n```bash\n/specify [project description]\n```\nProvide a high-level description focusing on the \"what\" and \"why\" of your project, avoiding technical implementation details[4].\n\n**2. Generate Technical Plan**\n```bash\n/plan [technical direction]\n```\nSteer the AI to create a detailed implementation plan that respects your architecture and constraints[4].\n\n**3. Break Down Into Tasks**\n```bash\n/tasks\n```\nConvert the specification and plan into a list of actionable development tasks that your coding agent can execute[4].\n\n**Example Project Flow**\n\n```bash\n# Initialize new project\nuvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init my-web-app\n\n# Create specification\n/specify \"Build a task management web application with user authentication, project organization, and real-time collaboration features\"\n\n# Generate technical plan\n/plan \"Use React frontend with Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and WebSocket connections for real-time features\"\n\n# Create actionable tasks\n/tasks\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\n**Command-Line Interface**\n\n**Installation Command**\n- `specify init <PROJECT_NAME>` - Initialize new Spec Kit project\n\n**AI Agent Commands** (used within your coding environment)\n- `/specify <description>` - Generate project specification from high-level description\n- `/plan <technical_direction>` - Create detailed technical implementation plan  \n- `/tasks` - Break down specification into actionable tasks\n\n**Template Management**\n- Download specific templates for different AI agents from GitHub releases\n- Templates are automatically configured during project initialization[4][5]\n\n## Integration Guide\n\n**GitHub Copilot Integration**\n\n1. Install GitHub Copilot extension in your IDE\n2. Initialize project with Copilot template: `specify init <project> --agent=copilot`\n3. Use Spec Kit commands directly in Copilot chat interface\n\n**Claude Code Integration**\n\n1. Set up Claude Code CLI access\n2.

It serves as both a model manager and runtime environment, enabling developers to download, deploy, and execute open-source models such as Llama 3, DeepSeek R1, Mistral, Phi-4, and Gemma 2 without requiring internet connectivity or cloud-based APIs[2].\n\n## Overview & Purpose\n\nOllama addresses the growing need for **local AI deployment** by providing enhanced security, privacy, and greater control over model performance[2]. The platform allows developers to customize models on their workstations while maintaining complete data sovereignty. Key advantages include offline functionality, reduced latency, cost elimination for cloud services, and the ability to run models on various hardware configurations including graphics cards[6].\n\nThe tool supports multiple operating systems including Linux, Windows, and macOS, making it accessible across different development environments[2]. Ollama includes a default models repository that enables easy searching and downloading of LLMs, and it integrates seamlessly with graphical interfaces like OpenWebUI for users who prefer web-based interactions over command-line operations[2].\n\n## Installation & Setup\n\n### **Windows Installation**\nDownload the **OllamaSetup.exe** from the official website and execute the installer[4]. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.\n\n### **Linux Installation**\nInstall Ollama using a single command:\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n### **macOS Installation**\nDownload the appropriate installer from the official GitHub repository and follow the standard macOS installation procedure[5].\n\n### **Verification**\nAfter installation, verify the setup by checking the version:\n```bash\nollama --version\n```\nThis should display output similar to:\n```\nollama version is 0.6.2\n```\n\n## Core Features\n\n**Model Management**: Ollama provides comprehensive model lifecycle management including downloading, updating, and removing models from your local system[4].\n\n**Local API Server**: All local models are automatically served on `localhost:11434`, providing a REST API for application integration[3].\n\n**Multiple Model Support**: The platform supports various model families including Llama, Mistral, CodeLlama, and other open-source alternatives[4].\n\n**Context Window Management**: Users can manually configure context windows to optimize memory usage and performance based on available system resources[3].\n\n**Thinking Mode**: Advanced models support reasoning and reflection processes before generating final responses, enabled through the thinking parameter[3].\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### **Basic Model Deployment**\n```bash\n# Download a model\nollama pull llama3.1:latest\n\n# Run a model interactively\nollama run llama3.1:latest\n\n# List available models\nollama list\n```\n\n### **Python Integration with LlamaIndex**\n```python\nfrom llama_index.llms.ollama import Ollama\n\n# Basic configuration\nllm = Ollama(\n    model=\"llama3.1:latest\", \n    request_timeout=120.0,\n    context_window=8000,\n)\n\n# Generate response\nresp = llm.complete(\"Who is Paul Graham?\")\nprint(resp)\n```\n\n### **Advanced Configuration with Thinking**\n```python\nfrom llama_index.llms.ollama import Ollama\n\nllm = Ollama(\n    model=\"qwen3:8b\",\n    request_timeout=360,\n    thinking=True,\n    context_window=8000,\n)\n\nresp = llm.complete(\"What is 434 / 22?\")\nprint(resp.additional_kwargs[\"thinking\"])\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\n### **Default Endpoint**\n- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:11434`\n- **Default Port**: 11434[3][6]\n\n### **Model Selection Parameters**\n- `model`: Specify model name and version (e.g., \"llama3.1:latest\")\n- `request_timeout`: Configure timeout duration (default: 30 seconds)\n- `context_window`: Set maximum context tokens for memory management\n- `thinking`: Enable reasoning mode for supported models\n\n### **Timeout Configuration**\nIncrease default timeout for larger models or slower systems:\n```python\nOllama(..., request_timeout=300.0)\n```\n\n## Integration Guide\n\n### **Kubernetes Deployment**\nFor scalable deployments, create a ConfigMap for automated startup:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: ollama-entrypoint\ndata:\n  entrypoint.sh: |\n    #!/bin/bash\n    # Custom startup script for Ollama service\n```\n\n### **Docker Integration**\nOllama leverages ready-to-use Docker containers for consistent deployment across environments[1]. This approach enables seamless integration with container orchestration platforms.\n\n### **Third-Party Platform Integration**\nConfigure Ollama with platforms like Unstract by:\n1. Setting up the LLM profile in the target platform\n2. Configuring the URL (typically `http://localhost:11434` or `http://host.docker.internal:11434`)\n3. Specifying the model name from Ollama's model repository\n4. Setting appropriate context window limits[6]\n\n## Configuration\n\n### **URL Configuration**\n- **Local Development**: `http://localhost:11434`\n- **Docker Environment**: `http://host.docker.internal:11434`\n- **Custom Port**: Modify the port number if running on non-default configuration[6]\n\n### **Model Context Configuration**\nSet context window limits based on available system memory:\n```python\ncontext_window=8000  # Adjust based on system capabilities\n```\n\n### **Timeout Settings**\nConfigure appropriate timeouts for model loading and inference:\n- Default: 30 seconds\n- Recommended for larger models: 300+ seconds[3]\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### **Connection Issues**\nIf experiencing connectivity problems, verify:\n- Ollama service is running (`ollama` command should show CLI interface)\n- Correct port configuration (default: 11434)\n- Firewall settings allow local connections\n- Docker networking configuration in containerized environments\n\n### **Memory Management**\nFor memory-related issues:\n- Reduce context window size\n- Use smaller model variants\n- Ensure sufficient system RAM for target models\n\n### **Model Loading Problems**\n- Verify model name spelling and version availability\n- Check internet connectivity for initial model downloads\n- Ensure adequate disk space for model storage\n\n## Best Practices\n\n**Resource Optimization**: Always set appropriate context windows to prevent memory overflow and optimize performance based on available system resources[3].\n\n**Timeout Configuration**: Increase timeout values for larger models or when running on resource-constrained systems to prevent premature connection failures.\n\n**Model Selection**: Choose model sizes appropriate for your hardware capabilities. Start with smaller models for testing before deploying larger variants.\n\n**Security Considerations**: When deploying in production environments, implement proper network security measures and access controls, especially for Kubernetes deployments[1].\n\n**Version Management**: Specify exact model versions rather than using \"latest\" tags in production environments to ensure consistency and reproducibility.\n\n## Resources\n\n**Official Repository**: The primary source for Ollama downloads and documentation is available at https://github.com/ollama/ollama[5]. This repository contains the latest releases, installation instructions, and community contributions.\n\n**Model Library**: Access the comprehensive model catalog through Ollama's website to discover available models and their specifications.\n\n**Community Support**: Engage with the Ollama community through GitHub issues and discussions for troubleshooting, feature requests, and best practice sharing.\n\n**Integration Examples**: Refer to platform-specific documentation such as LlamaIndex integration guides for detailed implementation examples and advanced configuration options.",

I should be honest about this limitation.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided search results, I cannot find specific information about a tool called \"Local Universal LLM\" designed specifically for UBOS self-hosted LLM solutions. The search results do not contain documentation or references to this particular tool.\n\nHowever, I can provide information about local LLM solutions that could potentially be integrated with UBOS platform based on the available search results:\n\n## Available Local LLM Solutions\n\n**UBOS Platform Context**\nUBOS is a powerful low-code platform designed to facilitate rapid development and deployment of web applications[2]. The platform supports building AI-powered solutions, including chatbots that provide intelligent responses to customer inquiries, and can integrate with multiple channels such as email, social media, and SMS[2].\n\n**Local LLM Integration Options**\n\n### Ollama Integration\nOne of the most practical approaches for local LLM deployment involves using Ollama, which is an open-source tool that runs LLMs directly on local machines in isolated environments[1]. Here's how it works:\n\n```bash\n# Download and install Ollama\n$ ollama pull llama3.2:1b\n\n# Install required packages\n$ pip install langchain\n$ pip install -qU langchain-ollama\n```\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_ollama import ChatOllama\n\nllm = ChatOllama(\n    model=\"llama3.2:1b\",\n)\n\nmessages = [\n    (\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French. Translate the user sentence.\"),\n    (\"human\", \"I love programming.\"),\n]\n\nai_msg = llm.invoke(messages)\nprint(ai_msg.content)\n```\n\n### MLC LLM Solution\nAnother option is MLC LLM, which is described as \"a machine learning compiler and high-performance deployment engine for large language models\" with a mission \"to enable everyone to develop, optimize, and deploy AI models natively\"[6].\n\n## Alternative Approaches\n\nFor organizations looking to implement local LLM solutions with platforms like UBOS, consider:\n\n- **LM Studio**: Can be connected for custom LLM deployment and management[3]\n- **Third-party connectors**: Various preconfigured connectors are available for different LLM providers[3]\n- **Open-source inference tools**: Multiple categories exist including LLM inference backend engines, front-end UIs, and all-in-one desktop applications[5]\n\nIf you're specifically looking for \"Local Universal LLM\" for UBOS, I recommend checking the official UBOS documentation or community resources, as this specific tool does not appear in the current search results. The platform's low-code nature suggests that LLM integration might be available through their template system or custom integrations[2].",

This comprehensive documentation provides everything you need to effectively use Docker in your development workflow.\n\n## Overview & Purpose\n\nDocker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure, creating a consistent environment that runs identically across development, testing, and production systems[3]. At its core, Docker uses containers - lightweight, standalone packages that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings[2].\n\n**Primary Use Cases:**\n\nDocker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers, making it ideal for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows[3]. The platform provides fast, consistent delivery of applications where developers can write code locally, share work using Docker containers, push applications to test environments, and deploy to production seamlessly[3].\n\nThe containerization approach offers responsive deployment and scaling capabilities, with Docker containers running on developer laptops, physical or virtual machines in data centers, cloud providers, or mixed environments[3]. This portability and lightweight nature enables dynamic workload management, allowing you to scale applications up or down based on business needs in near real-time[3].\n\n## Installation & Setup\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- Supported operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows)\n- Administrative privileges for installation\n- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended\n- 64-bit processor architecture\n\n**Installation Steps:**\n\n**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**\n```bash\n# Update package index\nsudo apt-get update\n\n# Install required packages\nsudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release\n\n# Add Docker's official GPG key\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg\n\n# Set up repository\necho \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null\n\n# Install Docker Engine\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin\n\n# Verify installation\nsudo docker run hello-world\n```\n\n**Windows/macOS:**\nDownload Docker Desktop from the official website and follow the installation wizard. Docker Desktop provides a comprehensive local environment for building and testing containerized applications with integrated development tools[2].\n\n## Core Features\n\nDocker's architecture centers around the **Docker Engine**, a client-server application with three major components: a server daemon process (dockerd), the Docker API for communication, and a command-line interface (CLI)[4].\n\n**Key Capabilities:**\n\n**Containerization and Isolation:** Docker containers provide high-level isolation between applications, preventing them from interacting with or affecting each other[1]. The platform uses Linux kernel features like namespaces and cgroups to isolate the container's view of the operating system and limit resource access[4].\n\n**Image Management:** Docker can automatically build containers based on application source code and track versions of container images, enabling rollbacks to previous versions[6]. Images serve as blueprints for creating containers, containing all necessary components for application execution[1].\n\n**Networking and Volume Management:** Advanced networking capabilities allow containers to communicate securely while volume management enables persistent data storage across container lifecycles[1].\n\n**Security and Scalability:** Built-in security measures protect code throughout the development lifecycle, while the scalable architecture supports both individual developers and large organizations[1][2].\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n**Basic Container Operations:**\n\n```bash\n# Pull an image from Docker Hub\ndocker pull nginx:latest\n\n# Run a container\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 --name my-nginx nginx:latest\n\n# List running containers\ndocker ps\n\n# Stop a container\ndocker stop my-nginx\n\n# Remove a container\ndocker rm my-nginx\n\n# View container logs\ndocker logs my-nginx\n```\n\n**Building Custom Images:**\n\n```dockerfile\n# Dockerfile example\nFROM node:16-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\nEXPOSE 3000\nCMD [\"npm\", \"start\"]\n```\n\n```bash\n# Build image from Dockerfile\ndocker build -t my-app:1.0 .\n\n# Run the custom application\ndocker run -p 3000:3000 my-app:1.0\n```\n\n**Multi-Container Applications with Docker Compose:**\n\n```yaml\n# docker-compose.yml\nversion: '3.8'\nservices:\n  web:\n    build: .\n    ports:\n      - \"3000:3000\"\n    environment:\n      - NODE_ENV=production\n  database:\n    image: postgres:13\n    environment:\n      - POSTGRES_DB=myapp\n      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password\n```\n\n```bash\n# Start multi-container application\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n# Scale services\ndocker-compose up -d --scale web=3\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\n**Core CLI Commands:**\n\n**Image Commands:**\n- `docker build` - Build images from Dockerfile\n- `docker pull` - Download images from registry\n- `docker push` - Upload images to registry\n- `docker images` - List local images\n- `docker rmi` - Remove images\n\n**Container Commands:**\n- `docker run` - Create and start containers\n- `docker start/stop/restart` - Manage container state\n- `docker exec` - Execute commands in running containers\n- `docker inspect` - Display detailed container information\n- `docker logs` - View container output\n\n**System Commands:**\n- `docker system prune` - Clean up unused resources\n- `docker info` - Display system information\n- `docker version` - Show Docker version details\n\n**Docker REST API:**\nThe Docker API provides programmatic access to Docker functionality through HTTP endpoints, enabling automation and integration with external tools[4]. Key endpoints include container management, image operations, network configuration, and system monitoring.\n\n## Integration Guide\n\n**Development Tool Integration:**\n\nDocker seamlessly integrates with popular development tools including VS Code, CircleCI, and GitHub[2]. The platform supports various programming languages and provides pre-built components through Docker Hub, security scanning via Docker Scout, and integration with third-party tools[2].\n\n**CI/CD Pipeline Integration:**\n\n```yaml\n# GitHub Actions example\nname: Docker Build and Deploy\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - name: Build Docker image\n      run: docker build -t myapp:${{ github.sha }} .\n    - name: Push to registry\n      run: docker push myapp:${{ github.sha }}\n```\n\n**Cloud Platform Integration:**\nDocker ensures consistent application performance across environments, whether on-premises Kubernetes or cloud platforms like AWS ECS, Azure ACI, and Google GKE[2].\n\n## Configuration\n\n**Docker Daemon Configuration:**\nThe Docker daemon can be configured through `/etc/docker/daemon.json` on Linux systems:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"storage-driver\": \"overlay2\",\n  \"log-driver\": \"json-file\",\n  \"log-opts\": {\n    \"max-size\": \"10m\",\n    \"max-file\": \"3\"\n  },\n  \"registry-mirrors\": [\"https://mirror.gcr.io\"]\n}\n```\n\n**Environment Variables:**\n- `DOCKER_HOST` - Docker daemon socket location\n- `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` - Enable TLS verification\n- `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` - Path to TLS certificates\n\n**Resource Limits:**\nConfigure container resource constraints using runtime options:\n\n```bash\n# Limit memory and CPU\ndocker run -m 512m --cpus=\"1.5\" my-app\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Common Issues:**\n\n**Permission Denied Errors:**\n```bash\n# Add user to docker group (Linux)\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n# Logout and login again\n```\n\n**Container Connectivity Issues:**\n```bash\n# Check container networking\ndocker network ls\ndocker inspect container_name\n```\n\n**Storage Space Problems:**\n```bash\n# Clean up unused resources\ndocker system prune -a --volumes\n```\n\n**Performance Optimization:**\n- Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size\n- Implement .dockerignore files to exclude unnecessary files\n- Choose appropriate base images (alpine variants for smaller footprint)\n\n## Best Practices\n\n**Image Creation:**\n- Use official base images when possible\n- Minimize image layers by combining RUN commands\n- Implement proper security scanning and vulnerability management\n- Follow principle of least privilege for container users\n\n**Container Management:**\n- Use health checks to monitor container status\n- Implement proper logging strategies with log rotation\n- Set resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion\n- Use secrets management for sensitive data\n\n**Production Deployment:**\n- Implement container orchestration with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm\n- Use load balancers for high availability\n- Establish monitoring and alerting systems\n- Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures\n\n## Resources\n\n**Official Documentation:**\n- Docker Official Documentation: Primary resource for comprehensive guides and references\n- Docker Hub: Repository for official and community images\n- Docker GitHub Repository: Source code and issue tracking\n\n**Community Resources:**\n- Docker Community Forums: Peer support and discussions\n- Stack Overflow Docker Tag: Technical Q&A platform\n- Docker Blog: Latest updates and best practices\n\n**Learning Materials:**\n- Docker Official Training: Structured learning paths\n- Interactive Tutorials: Hands-on learning environments\n- Certification Programs: Docker Certified Associate credentials\n\nDocker's lightweight and fast nature provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based virtual machines, enabling you to use more server capacity to achieve business goals[3].
